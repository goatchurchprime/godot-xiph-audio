# Xiph Audio for Godot

A cross-platform GDExtension that makes Xiph.Org audio formats first-class
Godot `AudioStream` resources. It currently supports Ogg Opus (`.opus`) through
`AudioStreamOggOpus` and FLAC (`.flac`) through `AudioStreamFLAC`.

```gdscript
var voice := load("res://voice.opus") as AudioStreamOggOpus
var music := load("res://music.flac") as AudioStreamFLAC
$AudioStreamPlayer.stream = music
$AudioStreamPlayer.play()
```

Both resources support duration reporting, playback, seeking, simultaneous
playbacks, and optional looping with a loop offset. Compressed bytes remain in
the resource and are decoded incrementally, so FLAC conserves project and
resident compressed-data memory instead of being expanded into a complete WAV
buffer by this addon.

This project is independent of [TwoVoIP](https://github.com/goatchurchprime/two-voip-godot-4),
which handles live raw Opus packets. Xiph Audio handles stored audio files. It
provides decoding/playback only; it does not replace Godot's `save_to_wav()`
with audio conversion or encoding APIs.

## Install

Download `godot-xiph-audio.zip` from a release and extract it at the root of a
Godot project. It contains only `addons/xiph_audio`. The GDExtension loads
automatically; there is no EditorPlugin to enable.

Release archives support Linux and Windows x86-64, universal macOS, iOS arm64,
all four Android architectures, and threaded or single-threaded Web exports.
The minimum supported engine version is Godot 4.5.

## Migrating from Godot Ogg Opus

The repository and Asset Library entry are now named **Xiph Audio for Godot**.
Replace `addons/ogg_opus` with `addons/xiph_audio`; do not keep both copies.
Existing `.opus` files and `AudioStreamOggOpus` scripts/resources remain
compatible. The native filename and descriptor changed internally and require
no script changes.

GitHub redirects links and clones after a repository rename. Existing local
clones can update their remote explicitly:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/goatchurchprime/godot-xiph-audio.git
```

## Build and test on NixOS

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
bash tools/build_linux.sh
bash tools/smoke_linux.sh
```

Distribution builds use SCons:

```bash
python -m pip install scons
scons build_ogg platform=linux target=template_debug arch=x86_64
scons build_opus platform=linux target=template_debug arch=x86_64
scons build_flac platform=linux target=template_debug arch=x86_64
scons platform=linux target=template_debug arch=x86_64
```

All codec dependencies are statically linked into one GDExtension binary.

## Bundled dependency versions

Release builds use the Git submodule commits pinned by this repository. They do
not automatically follow upstream branches, which keeps rebuilds reproducible.
The exact commit link is authoritative when a checkout is newer than an
upstream numbered release.

| Dependency | Version used | Pinned source | Release Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [libFLAC](https://github.com/xiph/flac) | 1.5.0 | [`1507800d`](https://github.com/xiph/flac/commit/1507800de4b70e21be71f38caa0d9079d0bc6e45) | 11 February 2025 |
| [libogg](https://github.com/xiph/ogg) | 1.3.6 development checkout | [`06a5e026`](https://github.com/xiph/ogg/commit/06a5e0262cdc28aa4ae6797627a783b5010440f0) | 2 March 2026 |
| [libopus](https://github.com/xiph/opus) | upstream development checkout | [`503d81b1`](https://github.com/xiph/opus/commit/503d81b138d76621aae4b12786e90de48aa8db3a) | 11 September 2026 |
| [libopusfile](https://github.com/xiph/opusfile) | v0.12 + 59 commits | [`6dfd29e7`](https://github.com/xiph/opusfile/commit/6dfd29e7adb87f2e193575fc3fa88cbf1a0b27df) | 28 March 2026 |
| [godot-cpp](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp) | Godot 4.5 branch checkout | [`27d9dd23`](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp/commit/27d9dd23c83871e0619fca5dc2cddfbfd69e926a) | 25 August 2026 |

These are the versions used by release `v0.2.0`. Updating a submodule is an
explicit maintenance change followed by the complete platform build matrix,
rather than an unreviewed update from an upstream `main` branch.

## Interactive demo and conformance fixtures

The `demo` project provides a shared play/pause, seek, position, and loop UI for
Ogg Opus, FLAC, and any optional native Godot WAV, Ogg Vorbis, or MP3 comparison
files. See `demo/README.md` for helpers that create local same-source comparison
files and download a focused CC0 FLAC conformance set.

## Releases and Godot Asset Store

Each GitHub Actions build produces `godot-xiph-audio.zip`. Tags publish the
same archive to a GitHub release. Use that release archive—not GitHub's source
archive—as the Asset Store download, since source archives omit compiled
binaries and submodule contents.

Suggested fields are **Xiph Audio for Godot**, tags **Audio**, **Opus**,
**FLAC**, **GDExtension**, and **Cross-platform**, license **MIT**, and minimum
Godot version **4.5**. The 16:9 listing thumbnail is
`docs/asset-store-thumbnail.png`.

Third-party sources retain their licenses: FLAC, Opus, opusfile, and libogg
(BSD-style), and godot-cpp (MIT). See the packaged notices for details.

## AI assistance

OpenAI Codex was used as a coding agent to discuss scope, implement substantial
portions of the GDExtension and FLAC support, add cross-platform build and
release packaging, and diagnose build failures. Julian Todd directed and
reviewed the work and remains responsible for the project and its releases.
